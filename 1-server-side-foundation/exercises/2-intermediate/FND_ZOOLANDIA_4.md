# Zoolandia - Purchasing Animals for your Zoo

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/workspace/zoolandia
git checkout -b version-4
```

## Instructions

1. Decide on ~6 species that you would like to include in your zoo and create a class for each species. 
1. Each species should inherit from the appropriate genus (in a class that you create), and each genus should inherit from the `Animal` class.

```cs
// Base animal class
public class Animal 
{
	// add properties and methods
}

// Genus class, inherits from animal class
public class Equus : Animal 
{
	//add properties and methods
}

// Species class, inherits from the corresponding genus class
public class Quagga : Equus
{
    string commonName = "Zebra";
	string scientificName = "Equus quagga";
	// add more properties and methods
}
```

1. Once you've created all of your species, give them some methods and properties. Include several methods on your Animal and/or genus classes that can be overridden and then override them in your species classes.
1. Create some overloaded methods on some of your species (or genus) classes.

> **Examples:** Here's some ideas on methods you can add to an animal.
> 
> * `walk()` and `walk(double speed)` and `walk(double speed, string destination)`
> * `eat()` and `eat(string food)`
> * `sleep()` and `sleep(int hours)` and `sleep(int hours, string location)`
