#Zoolandia - Specializing Derived Classes

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/workspace/zoolandia
git checkout -b version-2
```

## Instructions

### Virtual/Override

1. Choose one of the general methods that you created in the `Animal` class and make it `virtual`.
1. Override that method in all of your species classes, giving each a more specialized implementation. For example, the species may only eat certain kinds of food, or have a limit on how much food can be eaten.
1. Make sure you invoke the parent class' overridden method with the `base` reference (e.g. `base.sleep()`);

### Constructors

1. Create a constructor function for each of your animals. The constructor function should, at the very least, set the initial name of all animals of that type to a name of your choosing.
  
  ```cs
  public MyAnimal ()
  {
    this.name = "Moopsie";
  }
  ```

1. Use `Console.WriteLine();` to output the name of each of your animal instances.

  ```cs
  MyAnimal animalInstance = new MyAnimal();
  Console.WriteLine(animalInstance.name);
  ```
