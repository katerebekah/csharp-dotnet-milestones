## Installs

### .NET Core

[.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) is the most recent version of the platform that we'll be using in class. It now runs on Linux, OSX and Windows, which means that you can be up and running in a matter of minutes. You will learn the basics of the language while you get Windows and the full Visual Studio IDE installed.

### Visual Studio

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) will be your first editor while learning the language. While not as powerful as the full Visual Studio IDE that you will install on Windows, it has **many** of the features and you can build most any moderately complex project with it.

* After you have Windows installed in a VM, or through Parallels, install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) which will be your Windows coding environment while working with C# and .NET.

> **Note:** Did you have snippets in Sublime or Atom? You can [make them](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userdefinedsnippets) in Code, too.

### SQL Server

* Visit the [SQL Server Express 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35579) page, click the download button and select the  `SQLEXPR_x64_ENU.exe` and the `	
SQLManagementStudio_x64_ENU.exe` which installs the SQL Server Mangement Studio.
