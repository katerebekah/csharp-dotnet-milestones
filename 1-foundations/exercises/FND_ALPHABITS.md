#Alphabits

Use visual studio and C# to build a console app where the user is challenged to enter all the letters of the 
alphabet, one at a time,  without repeating any, and without typing any non-letter characters.

###Behavior
1. After each successful input,  display the number of letters already entered.
1. After each unsccussful input, display a helpful message explaining why the input was unsuccessful 
(not a letter, duplicate letter, etc)
1. Upon completing the task (entering in all 26 letters), the user should receive some gratifying message like
"Congratulations"

###Technical requirements
1. Use one Class in addition to the program file.
1. Your class should include  a constructor function, an "addChar" method, and a "listLength" method.
1. Keep your user's successfully input letters as a list of characters
1. Use the String.Format method to craft your messages to users

####Bonus Requirements
1. Create a returnList Method on your class
1. Create a non-letter "Easter egg" character that will display the current list of successfully input letters 
(but will not add itself to the list!)
