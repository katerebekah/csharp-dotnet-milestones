# Zoolandia - Refactoring Relationships

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/workspace/zoolandia
git checkout -b version-5
```

## Instructions

Is a species a genus?

Is a genus an animal?

Isn't species a *property* of an animal instead?

What if the genus was a property of the species?

Read the [inheritance, composition, and aggregation](../resources/FND_INHERIT_COMPOSE_AGGREGATE.md) file again and refactor your code to have appropriate `is-a`, `part-of`, and `has-a` relationships.
